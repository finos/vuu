# Developing Vuu

## Developing the server

1) Install IntelliJ Community Edition (latest version, tested with 2021.3)
2) Install SDKMan from the [website](https://sdkman.io/)
3) type>```sdk install java 16.0.1-open``` and then >```sdk d java 16.0.1-open``` to make sure you're using the correct one.
4) Clone the repo into a directory on your machine
5) Open the project as a Maven build by selecting the root pom.xml (make sure you select "enable adding maven modules, auto import etc..)
6) You should get one root module vuu-parent in a project list, select this
7) When the project opens you should have 2 sub modules (vuu and toolbox) 

## Running the Vuu Server Simulation Module

1) Go to the SimulMain.scala, right click and run (add these into JVM args -Xmx10G -Xms5G)
2) Go to the SwingClientMain.scala, right click and run

## Developing the client

1) install node.js version 14+ and yarn
2) In a terminal, change directory into the ./vuu-ui folder
3) yarn install
4) type> ```yarn```
5) build the ui library packages
6) type> ```yarn build```
7) build the sample application
8) change directory into ./vuu-ui/packages/app-vuu-example
9) type> ```yarn build```

If you want to host the javascript in yarn also (not required): 

10) run the sample application (in Yarn, not required ) 
11) type> ```yarn start```

You should know be able to use a local browser to see the Vuu demo app. [localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443/index.html) 

If you are getting certificate errors when you connect, set this browser setting in chrome: 

```
chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost (set to true)
```

## Developing the Vuu Book

We use the excellent [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) rust module for developing the Vuu book. To use this you first have to install rust, and 
then use the rust package manager cargo to install mdbook module. 

To build the book locally, run: 

```
mdbook build vuu-book
```

in the root vuu directory.
