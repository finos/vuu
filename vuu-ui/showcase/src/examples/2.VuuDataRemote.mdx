# VuuDataRemote

## Viewport Range management

Sequence of operations is:

### 1. client sends `setViewRange` message via worker

### 2. ServerProxy calls viewport.rangeRequest

this will return either or both the following

- a serverRequest `CHANGE_VP_RANGE` to request data for a new range
- a set of rows from local cache to satisfy client range request

The following logic is employed:

call dataWindow.setClientRange, this will return two values:

- serverDataRequired
- clientRows

  serverDataRequired is a true/false, if true we need to make a request to server
  clientRows are rows to be returned directly to client

  The following logic is employed:

  if dataWindow already contains all rows in clientRange, return those rows
  call bufferBreakout to set serverDataRequired - if new range comes withnin 25% of existing range, return true

back in Viewport ...
if serverDataRequired

- check if request already pending that would cover this range
- if so ignore
- if not, build new server request for 'full range' (client range plus buffer)

schedule a task to await the server range request ACK (see 6. below)

// check to see if we need to throttle requests

- new range jumped beyond last range before data received.

reset keys to match new range
if clientRows

- store lastRowsReturnedToClient
- convert VuuDataRows to DataSOurceRows

return serverRequest and clientRows to ServerProxy

### 4. send request to server (IF APPROPRIATE)

### 5. return rows to client (IF APPROPRIATE)

### 6. Receive CHANGE_VP_RANGE_SUCCESS (IF 4.)

    call viewport.completeOperation to complete the task scheduled earlier
        - call dataWindow.setRange(fullRange)
        - reset cache to new range dimensions, purge any rows outside range

        - mark pendingRangeRequest as acked

### 7. Receive TABLE_ROW

- call viewport.updateRows (on each viewport for which we've receibed data)
  for each row

  - dataWindow.setAtIndex - increments rowsWithinRange if we dataWindow did not have this row - return true if this update is within clientRange

- call processUpdates
  for each viewport with updates:
  - viewport.getClientRows
    always sends data rows for complete clientRange
  - postMessageToClient ("viewport-update")
