The Sample App comprises a login page, an index page (the VUU Shell) + one or more features

By default, the Filtered Grid feature is loaded. This can be overridden by useing the --features flag with the build

To build Sample App with just the Vuu Blotter

```
npm run build:app --features feature-vuu-blotter
```

To build Sample App with both the Vuu Blotter and the FilteredGrid

```
npm run build:app --features feature-filtered-grid,feature-vuu-blotter
```

A Feature must have the following properties:

- index.ts entrypoint at top level of feature folder
- index.ts exposes a default export which is a React Component
- feature folder sits inside sample-apps

When the build runs, features and the Shell will be combined as multiple entryPoints. The code-splitting logic of the
bundler (presently Esbuild) will create an optimised set of bundles. At the minimum, there will be one main js and css bundle, plus
one such pair for each feature. Code shared across features or between shell and features will end up in common bundles.
Features are loaded dynamically at runtime.
This is a very basic mechanism for decoupling shell and features and is 100% dependent on running everything through a single build.
In future, the plan is to move towards a truly decoupled patternm for feature loading - utilising ES6 module hosting.

All build outputs are written to vuu-ui/deployed-apps. The Vuuserver is configured by default to serve assets from here.

Note: pass --dev switch to any build to build in development mode.
