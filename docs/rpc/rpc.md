# Remote Procedure Calls

Remote procedure calls are way to add server side business logic to the client application. They come in two flavours:

- [Service Based RPC Calls](./service.md) - Where we wanto to be able to call specific calls from novel components we've written across the websocket
- [Menu Item RPC Calls](./Menu_items.md) - Where we want to add specific behaviour to grids for specific tables, without having to write new components.
