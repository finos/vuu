# Fluid UIs

Vuu's frontend is built around the idea of a "Fluid UI." A Fluid UI is the concept that there is no official designation
of how a UI should work or be put together, rather the UI offers a series of components, a layout manager which allows 
the user to drag and drop these components onto their screen, and also the ability to save the users UI state.

These put together mean that every given user should have the ability to create the perfect UI for their requirements.

# But I don't want to create my own UI, I want to copy someone else's...
