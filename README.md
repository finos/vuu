# Vuu

## The Realtime View Server

Welcome. We maintain a docusaurus site containing all the details of the project. Why not get started there:

https://vuu.finos.org/docs/introduction/intro

## Installation - Server

### Prerequisites

See the [Docs](https://vuu.finos.org/docs/getting_started/developing) for Java versions and install dependencies you need to have.

OS X & Linux:

```sh
#In your favourite code directory...
git clone https://github.com/finos/vuu.git
#cd into the repository
cd vuu
#run the maven compile step
mvn install
#cd into vuu, child in repo
cd vuu
#The server should now be started on your machine
mvn exec:exec
```

Windows:

```sh
this should be the same as Linux & macos just with windows adjusted paths
```

## Installation - Client

The UI scripts all run from the vuu/vuu-ui directory.

```sh
#from top-level vuu repo (not vuu child directory in repo)
cd vuu-ui
npm install
npm run build
npm run build:app
```

You can now open the demo app in your browser at https://127.0.0.1:8443/index.html

Alternatively, you may choose to run the demo app in Electron. First install Electron in the tools/electron folder:

```sh
#from top-level vuu repo (not vuu child directory in repo)
cd vuu-ui/tools/electron
npm install
```

Then, back in vuu-ui, run the launch script"

```sh
#from vuu/vuu-ui
npm run launch:demo:electron
```

## Configuring IntelliJ

You may prefer to run the backend using the IntelliJ IDE, if so, you will need to follow the Client Installation above to ensure that the project has built correctly.

1. Install the Scala plugin: file -> settings -> plugins
2. Install Scala 2.13.10
3. Set project SDK version to 11: file -> project structure -> select an SDK -> require version 11
4. Enable 'Use plugin registry': file -> settings -> build, execution, deployment -> Maven
5. Open Maven tab on the right and click install on vuu-parent -> lifecycle -> install
6. In the terminal, navigate to

```sh
vuu-ui/sample-apps/app-vuu-example
```

7. Run

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

8. In IntelliJ, select 'SimulMain' config and click run
9. If you get a 'certificate-unknown' error, set 'Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost' to 'Enabled' in your chrome settings

## Usage example
