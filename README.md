# Vuu
## The Realtime View Server

Welcome. We maintain a docusaurus book containing all the details of the project. Why not get started there: 

https://vuu.finos.org/docs/introduction/intro

## Installation - Server

### Prerequisites

See the [Docs](https://vuu.finos.org/docs/getting_started/developing) for Java versions and install dependencies you need to have. 

OS X & Linux:

```sh
#In your favourite code directory...
git clone https://github.com/finos/vuu.git
#cd into the repository
cd vuu
#run the maven compile step
mvn compile
#cd into vuu, child in repo
cd vuu
#The server should now be started on your machine
mvn exec:exec
```

Windows:

```sh
this should be the same as Linux & macos just with windows adjusted paths
```

## Installation - Client
```sh
#in vuu repo (not vuu child directory in repo)
cd vuu-ui
yarn
yarn build
yarn buid:app
cd packages/electron
#this should open an electron window pointing at https://localhost:8443/index.html
yarn start
```
